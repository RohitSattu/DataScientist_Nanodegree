# Machine Learning for Data Science (2018)
Machine learning has three main categories:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Scikit Learn
Scikit Learn is an open source library for solving Supervised and Unsupervised learning problems.

## Supervised Machine Learning
In supervised machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled data and predict outcomes.
Two categories of supervised learning are:
- Regression (Numerical Outcomes)
- Classification (Categorical Outcomes)

### Regression
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/gradient_descent.py)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/linear_regression.py)
- [Multi-Linear Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/multi_linear_regression.py)
- [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/poly_reg.py)
- [Regularization](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/regularization.py)
- [Feature Scaling](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/feature_scaling.py)
