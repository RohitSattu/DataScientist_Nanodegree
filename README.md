# Machine Learning for Data Science 
Machine learning has three main categories:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Machine Learning
In supervised machine learning, algorithms learn from labeled data and predict outcomes. 

[Computer: Labeled data -> Labeling data]

Two categories of supervised learning are:
- Regression (Numerical Outcomes)
- Classification (Categorical Outcomes)

### Regression
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/gradient_descent.py)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/linear_regression.py)
- [Multi-Linear Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/multi_linear_regression.py)
- [Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/poly_reg.py)
- [Regularization](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/regularization.py)
- [Feature Scaling](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/feature_scaling.py)

### Classification
- [Perceptron](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/perceptron.py)
- [Perceptron as Logical 'AND' Operator](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/and_perceptron.py)
- [Perceptron as Logical 'OR' Operator](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/or_perceptron.py)
- [Perceptron as Logical 'NOT' Operator](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/not_perceptron.py)
- [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/decision_tree.py)
- [Titanic Survival Model with Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb)
- [Spam Classifier with Naive Bayes Algorithm](https://github.com/RohitSattu/data_science/blob/master/Bayesian_Inference.ipynb)
